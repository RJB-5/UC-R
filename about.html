    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>
      Uncharted: Reloaded is a project aimed towards reviving the Multiplayers of Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3, that were shut down in 2019 by Naughty Dog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team is made up out of Players as passionate about the game as everyone else; and we have a Moderation Team, a Balance Team, A Modding Team, and more - our goal is to completely revive the Multiplayer and keep it updated and balanced.
